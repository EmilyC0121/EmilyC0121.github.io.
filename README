My cause is educating people about wildfires (what causes them and what we can do to help control them) and helping people who have been affected by wildfires and climate change. 
Wildfires are worsening and becoming megafires. These megafires are becoming more and more common as climate change gets worse. 
The megafires that California and Oregon are experiencing have arrived 30 years earlier than scientists predicted.
According to Scientific American, by the end of the century an area burned by a wildfire could be 77% higher, and by 2050, fires will scorch twice as much land in Southern California. 
Climate predictions never predicted the severe effects of climate change that we are seeing today.
